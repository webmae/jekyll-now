Welcome to the Capitol Theater! Inside this room, you will live an incredible experience during two days. You will learn about code, accessibility, personal empowerment, design, art and mostly life. You will be amazed, thrilled, mind-blown.

But first, we have to visit the stands...

Like always, you can discover the partners at their stand. Do you want to try the new Wacom tablet? Have some fun playing kicker with the Trivago team?

Or maybe you would like to relax, sitting in the huge punk flamingo and eating a vegan hot dog at AOE's stand?

During this edition, Storyblok offered a mechanical keyboard to the best tetris player at the event. As usual, Awork offered the most awesome stickers and other nice goodies.

And for those who were looking for new colleagues or a new opportunity, the Job Board was still there:

## The talks

### Linda Liukas - Programming Playgrounds or how to see code with children's eyes

Linda Liukas opened Monday's serie of conferences with a wonderful subject: children's eyes.    
I guess what she said about algorithm may sum up her statement: if you ask grown-up what is an algorithm, they will not be sure, they may talk about facebook, social media, not be sure really... But if you ask a child what is an algorithm, they will answer with confidence that it's a step by step solution to solving a problem.

She's teaching children curiosity, fearlessness, wonder. It reminded me of my time being a webdev trainer. It's so difficult to teach that to adults but she's right: this is something we should not lose sight of. Never.

Learn by experimenting, trying, touching, feeling... The best way to learn.

### Manuel Matuzović - Lost in Translation

A frontend developer’s job is to look at a design, interpret it, and translate it to HTML and CSS. Unfortunately, information often gets lost in translation because we rely too much on visual aspects of a design, rather than its semantic meaning.

During his conference, he made several calls, several messages. Like:

!["Home pages with ARIA present averaged 70% more detected errors than those without ARIA."]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/btconf2022/manuel4.JPG)

!["We're wrongfully downplaying the complexity of HTML due to the simplicity of its syntax."]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/btconf2022/manuel7.JPG)

!["Accessibility issues don't just come from what's visible in a design, but from what's not visible."]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/btconf2022/manuel8.JPG)

!["Learn how to test your sites with the keyboard and screen readers."]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/btconf2022/manuel9.JPG)
