Welcome to the Capitol Theater! Inside this room, you will live an incredible experience during two days. You will learn about code, accessibility, personal empowerment, design, art and mostly life. You will be amazed, thrilled, mind-blown.

But first, we have to visit the stands...

Like always, you can discover the partners at their stand. Do you want to try the new Wacom tablet? Have some fun playing kicker with the Trivago team?

Or maybe you would like to relax, sitting in the huge punk flamingo and eating a vegan hot dog at AOE's stand?

During this edition, Storyblok offered a mechanical keyboard to the best tetris player at the event. As usual, Awork offered the most awesome stickers and other nice goodies.

And for those who were looking for new colleagues or a new opportunity, the Job Board was still there:

## The talks

### Linda Liukas - Programming Playgrounds or how to see code with children's eyes

[![Thumbnail you can click on to launch the video of the conf of Linda]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/btconf2022/lindaliukas-youtube.jpg)](https://youtu.be/4F5UpsEcYhU)
Linda Liukas opened Monday's serie of conferences with a wonderful subject: children's eyes.    
I guess what she said about algorithm may sum up her statement: if you ask grown-up what is an algorithm, they will not be sure, they may talk about facebook, social media, not be sure really... But if you ask a child what is an algorithm, they will answer with confidence that it's a step by step solution to solving a problem.

She's teaching children curiosity, fearlessness, wonder. It reminded me of my time being a webdev trainer. It's so difficult to teach that to adults but she's right: this is something we should not lose sight of. Never.

Learn by experimenting, trying, touching, feeling... The best way to learn.

### Manuel Matuzović - Lost in Translation

[![Thumbnail you can click on to launch the video of the conf of Manuel]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/btconf2022/manuel-youtube.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Wno1IhEBTxc)

A frontend developer’s job is to look at a design, interpret it, and translate it to HTML and CSS. Unfortunately, information often gets lost in translation because we rely too much on visual aspects of a design, rather than its semantic meaning.

![A div is not a button]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/btconf2022/manuel3.JPG)

During his conference, he made several calls, several messages. Like:

!["Home pages with ARIA present averaged 70% more detected errors than those without ARIA."]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/btconf2022/manuel4.JPG)

!["We're wrongfully downplaying the complexity of HTML due to the simplicity of its syntax."]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/btconf2022/manuel7.JPG)

!["Accessibility issues don't just come from what's visible in a design, but from what's not visible."]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/btconf2022/manuel8.JPG)

!["Learn how to test your sites with the keyboard and screen readers."]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/btconf2022/manuel9.JPG)

### Stephanie Eeckles - Scaling CSS Layout Beyond Pixels: A talk about CSS and responsiveness
[![Thumbnail you can click on to launch the video of the conf of Stephanie]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/btconf2022/stephanie-youtube.jpg)](https://youtu.be/8slZJrTK3nE)

"Responsive designs being created today have to serve more users on more devices and with more varied abilities and preferences than ever before. And size and spacing of elements can quite literally make or break your layout. In this new world, strict pixel values are so Web 2.0. Let’s review modern CSS techniques for building future-forward flexibility into our layouts and components"

### Léonie Watson - Bag of Spanners
Oh la la ! Personaly, when I have the possibility to hear about accessibility directly from people who are concerned, I'm thrilled.

Lately, I only heard about accessibility from people with no impairement. It's like listening men talking about what it feels like to be a woman. In theory, you know some stuff, but you can never tell from experience. So indeed, listening to Léonie was a privilege to me, young UX designer in Belgium who had to improve a screen reader for TV all by myself. Sure, I have myopia so without my glasses, I have an impairement but I already know my TV interface. I'm always wondering about people who don't have glasses, who don't have options and have to rely on screen readers.

Well, what Léonie told us during her talk is that with an understanding of how accessibility mechanics work in the browser, knowledge of how to provide or polyfill accessibility semantics, and a little bit of effort, we can provide a qualitative and accessible experience to everyone.

### Aarron Walter - Returning to Your Maker Roots
